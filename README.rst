=====================
Thonny-deconstructed
=====================

This is a learning project, which is most likely of no use to anyone
but myself.  See the notes.md file in the notes/ directory for more details.

The starting point for this repository is the December 19, 2019 version
of `Thonny <https://thonny.org>`_.
The original code can be found at: `Thonny's repo <https://github.com/thonny/thonny>`_.  See the `licenses/` directory for the original Thonny license.

Thonny requires many packages found outside of the Python standard
library. One of the goals of this project is create a barebone version,
which would only use modules from the Python standard library.

Another goal is to get a better understanding of Thonny's architecture.

Why do this?
-------------

Thonny is, in my opinion a fantastic Python IDE for beginners learning
in a classroom environment. While both Thonny and Python's IDLE are based
on Tkinter, Thonny's UI is much more pleasant to use.

Eventually, I would like to create a barebone editor with a simple
plugin architecture that could be used as the basis for other projects.
