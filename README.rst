=====================
Thonny-deconstructed
=====================

The starting point for this repository is the December 19, 2019 version
of `Thonny <https://thonny.org>`_.
The original code can be found at: `Thonny's repo <https://github.com/thonny/thonny>`_.  See the `licenses/` directory for the original Thonny license.

Thonny is, in my opinion a fantastic Python IDE for beginners learning
in a classroom environment. While both Thonny and Python's IDLE are based
on Tkinter, Thonny's UI is much more pleasant to use.

Thonny requires many packages found outside of the Python standard
library. One of the goals of this project is create a barebone version,
which would only use modules from the Python standard library.
Another goal is to get a better understanding of Thonny's architecture.

Eventually, I would like to create a barebone editor with a simple
plugin architecture that could be used as the basis for other projects.
